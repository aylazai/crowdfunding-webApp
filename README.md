## Installation

To use this application, you will need to have Metamask installed on your browser and have some Ethereum in your wallet to make donations to the crowdfunding campaigns. Clone the repository and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the application and open it in your default browser. You can then connect your Metamask wallet to the application and start browsing available crowdfunding campaigns. If you wish to create your own campaign, you can do so through the "Create Campaign" feature, which will guide you through the process of creating and publishing a new campaign to the blockchain.
